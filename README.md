Maxwell Li's Repository for keeping notes and programs from the Open CV Computer
Science 1 Course that covers basic computer vision. Will also add the other 2 courses or more. This is planned to be central repo for learning. 

If you want to look at the notes themselves please navigate into the class you are interested in, then the week that you are interested in, go to the notes directory, then finally click on the notes.pdf if you want to see the pdf file or the notes.tex if you want to see the original latex code.
